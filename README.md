# fdns-js-sdk
This is the repository with the JavaScript SDK for Foundation Services.

## Running locally
Please read the following instructions carefully for information on how to run and test this SDK in your local environment.

### Before you start
You will need to have the following dependencies installed before getting up and running locally:

- [FDNS Gateway Microservice](https://github.com/CDCgov/fdns-ms-gateway), which must be running using that project's `make docker-start` command
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- **Windows Users**: Please use [Cygwin](http://www.cygwin.com/) for running commands in this README

## How to use
This SDK is designed to be used in React projects primarily created with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) projects.

### React
To use this in a React project built with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) use the following instructions:

```sh
create-react-app fdns-js-sdk-demo
cd fdns-js-sdk-demo
npm install --save CDCgov/fdns-js-sdk
$EDITOR src/App.js
```

Then in your `App.js` file include the following:

```javascript
import FDNS from 'fdns-js-sdk';

const fdns = new FDNS({
  HL7_UTILS_URL: 'http://localhost:8099/hl7',
  CDA_UTILS_URL: 'http://localhost:8099/cda',
  STORAGE_URL: 'http://localhost:8099/storage',
  OBJECT_URL: 'http://localhost:8099/object',
  INDEXING_URL: 'http://localhost:8099/indexing',
  COMBINER_URL: 'http://localhost:8099/combiner',
  RULES_URL: 'http://localhost:8099/rules',
});
```

**Note: The URLs of the endpoints here that are used are based on [FDNS Gateway Microservice](https://github.com/CDCgov/fdns-ms-gateway). These microservices will need to be running in order to point to these endpoints.**

### Node
To use this in a Node project, use the following instructions:

```
mkdir fdns-js-sdk-demo
cd fdns-js-sdk-demo
npm init
npm install --save CDCgov/fdns-js-sdk
$EDITOR src/server.js
```

Then in your `server.js` file include the following:

```javascript
const FDNS = require('fdns-js-sdk');

const fdns = new FDNS({
  HL7_UTILS_URL: 'http://localhost:8099/hl7',
  CDA_UTILS_URL: 'http://localhost:8099/cda',
  STORAGE_URL: 'http://localhost:8099/storage',
  OBJECT_URL: 'http://localhost:8099/object',
  INDEXING_URL: 'http://localhost:8099/indexing',
  COMBINER_URL: 'http://localhost:8099/combiner',
  RULES_URL: 'http://localhost:8099/rules',
});
```

**Note: The URLs of the endpoints here that are used are based on [FDNS Gateway Microservice](https://github.com/CDCgov/fdns-ms-gateway). These microservices will need to be running in order to point to these endpoints.**
